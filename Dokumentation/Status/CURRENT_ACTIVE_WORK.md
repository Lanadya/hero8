## CURRENT ACTIVE WORK: Improving Handover Mechanism & Transitioning to hero9

### Status: IN PROGRESS
We're implementing two critical changes simultaneously:
1. Enhancing the handover script to include current work status
2. Preparing for hero8 to hero9 transition due to framework architecture issues

### Current Step
- Added CURRENT_ACTIVE_WORK.md tracking in Dokumentation/Status/
- Modified ki_handover.sh to include current work status (using nano)
- Created update_current_work.sh script to easily update status
- Identified build issues in hero8 caused by nested frameworks created with keyboard shortcuts

### Immediate Next Actions
1. Verify that ki_handover.sh correctly includes the current work status
2. Test run the update_current_work.sh script 
3. Begin implementing the hero9 project following the detailed framework creation guide
4. Ensure proper Info.plist files and non-nested framework structure in hero9

### Technical Context
- hero8 has duplicate Info.plist issues and "No such module" errors
- The decision has been made to create a fresh hero9 project with proper structure
- Current work is focused on ensuring seamless knowledge transfer during this transition

### Blocking Issues
- None technical, awaiting verification of handover script modifications
