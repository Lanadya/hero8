## CURRENT ACTIVE WORK: Transitioning from hero8 to hero9

### Status: CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL DECISION PHASE
We are in the process of transitioning from hero8 to hero9 due to fundamental framework architecture issues. This is the highest priority task currently.

### Current Step
- Decision made to create fresh hero9 project rather than fix nested framework issues in hero8
- Comprehensive setup guide for hero9 has been created (see TRANSITION_TO_HERO9_PLAN.md)
- Initial hero9 project creation is the next immediate step

### Specific Framework Issues in hero8
- Frameworks were created using keyboard shortcuts resulting in nested structures
- Current build errors show duplicate Info.plist file issues
- "No such module" errors appearing when frameworks reference each other
- Multiple attempts at reorganization have not resolved the underlying issues

### Immediate Next Actions
1. Create new hero9 project following the exact framework structure in the transition guide
2. Set up proper non-nested frameworks with correct Info.plist files
3. Establish clear dependency relationships between frameworks
4. Migrate code from hero8 to hero9 only after framework structure is verified

### Blocking Issues
- None technical, awaiting implementation of new project structure

**DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CONTINUE FIXING HERO8 FRAMEWORK ISSUES. The decision has been made to transition to hero9 with a proper architecture.**
